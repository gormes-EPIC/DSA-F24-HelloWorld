# GitHub Classroom, IntelliJ, and Deliverables

When you accept an assignment, GitHub Classroom automatically creates a new repository for you, using my template. You are not the owner of this repository, so it won't show up on your personal GitHub profile. However, you will be able to access it by searching [EPIC-Campus-LPS repositories](https://github.com/orgs/EPIC-Campus-LPS/repositories). All of your repositories will have your username in the title, which should make it easy to find if you lose the link. 

For all the labs we will use GitHub for, I will provide you with a link to accept the assignment and create your repository via Google Classroom. Each of these repositories will have a copy of the instructions and any additional starter code or materials you need. You will submit your work by **#1** uploading your work to your repository and **#2** marking the assignment 'Complete' on Google Classroom. 

If I update the assignment *after you have created your repository*, you should see the a message like 'This branch is 1 commits behind `really_long_repository_name`' appear at the top of the main page of your repository on GitHub. To sync my updates to your repository, hit the 'Sync Fork' button.  

When you are working on a project, you are encouraged to back up your work by uploading it to GitHub at least once every class.

1. To practice this, accept [this assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/u9XeWJf4)
2. Open IntelliJ Community Edition on your computer. This is an IDE or integrated development environment created for Java. 
3. Instead of creating a new project, click 'Get from VCS'. 
4. Copy the URL from the blue 'Quick Start' box of your assignment repository in your browser. Paste it into the URL box on IntelliJ and click on the folder on the right to select which folder on your computer you want to use for this project. Then his 'Clone'
5. Now, you should see a Java project with a `README` and a Hello World! program. Make sure you can run the Java program and see the output.
6. Add a comment to your Hello World program and save the file.
7. Go to the Git menu on the top of the window and select 'Commit'. You should see the commit menu on the left side and a list of files you edited with checkboxes. Add a commit message then the blue 'Commit' button. This will stage and commit all of the files that you have selected.
8. Go back to the Git menu and select 'Push'. A window should pop up and show you the commits you made. Hit the  blue 'Push' button at the bottom and you should see the changes reflected on the repository in your browser. Whenever you push your work to GitHub, I will see the reflected changes. This is how I will distribute and collect lab (assignments in this class.
9. When you are done, mark this assignment complete on Google Classroom.
